Two sorted lists have been created, one implemented using a linked list (LinkedListLibrary linkedListLibrary) and the other implemented using the built-in ArrayList class (ArrayListLibrary arrayListLibrary). Each list contains 100 books (title, ISBN number, author), sorted in ascending order by ISBN number.

Complete main() by inserting a new book into each list using the respective LinkedListLibrary and ArrayListLibrary insertSorted() methods and outputting the number of operations the computer must perform to insert the new book. Each insertSorted() returns the number of operations the computer performs.

Ex: If the input is:
    The Catcher in the Rye
    9787543321724
    J.D. Salinger

the output is:
    Number of linked list operations: 1
    Number of ArrayList operations: 1

Which list do you think will require the most operations? Why?
